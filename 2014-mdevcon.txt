I am a software developer and a build master of mobile solutions at Sitecore. 
I am an active participant of the ukrainian iOS developer community. 

I used to be a speaker at an international @iOSonRailConf conference.
I have also participated in a number of conferences in Ukraine and Russia  such as @ua_mobile, mobiledays, #iosdevorgua and "ADC SpB". 

I've been working with mobile devices from the very beginning of my career. I started as a junior foreinsic specialist. During the last 3 years I've been working at iOS applications and SDKs.
