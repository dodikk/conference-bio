I am a software developer and a build master of mobile solutions at Sitecore.  Beside building applications, I have experience of vendoring both OpenSource and corporate frameworks for iOS. Having three years of CocoaTouch experience, I switched to Monotouch (Xamarin iOS) this year and I'd really like to share this experience with the #mceconf community.

I've been public speaker for already three years and I am an active participant of the ukrainian iOS developer community (including @CocoaHeadsUA) . I used to be a speaker at an international @iOSonRailConf conference. I have also participated in a number of conferences in Ukraine and Russia  such as @CocoaHeadsUA, @ua_mobile, mobiledays, #iosdevorgua and "ADC SpB".
