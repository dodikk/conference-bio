The RubyMotion platform is getting more and more popular these days. The internet is full of success stories and testimonials. Still, there are some obstacles not mentioned in buzzwords and press releases. In this talk I'm going to reveal those and describe the issues my team has encountered while migrating from Objective-C to RubyMotion.
===============


The talk is for those Objective-C++ developers who have not tried it yet and still doubt whether RubyMotion is worth their efforts. Attending this talk will give you a better overview of what problems RubyMotion won't solve for you and what RubyMotion is really good for. Ruby developers will get to know a bit of Objective-C world and gain a better understanding of the platform. There will be a bit of criticism of RubyMotion. So, welcome RubyMotion fans. It's going to be a hot and interesting dispute.
